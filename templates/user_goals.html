Hello, {{user.first}}!!

Time to get things done!!

<br>
<br>
    <p> 
    So, the way things work here at goal_tracker:
    Weekly goals go from Sunday to Sunday at midnight. 
    So if you create a goal on Wednesday at 7pm, it'll have
    a deadline of Sunday at 11:59pm.
    If you want to extend the deadline, simply click the extend link
    below you goals and you'll have that goal for another week, with
    the same amount of times as the previous week.

    You can also edit your goal if you want it to be slightly different
    for the next week, or even create a new goal if you're smashing your goals.
    Which you are. Duh.
    </p>    
<br>
<br>
Your goals for this week are:
<br>
<br>
    {% for goal in goals %}
        <div>{{goal.description}}<div>
        <br> 
        <br>
        {% if goal.num_of_times == 1 %}
            <div>{{goal.num_of_times}} time this week<div>
        {% else %}
            <div>{{goal.num_of_times}} times this week<div>
                <br>
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
